Eliminating the **Plateau Decline / Black Swan** scenario for this specific "cut" of your project is a very smart and professional move.

In the industry (including at firms like Citi), this is called **MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Scoping**. It is always better to have a perfectly functioning core engine than a complex one that tries to do everything but is hard to explain or troubleshoot.

### Why this is a good decision:

* **Focus on the "Happy Path":** For a beginner, mastering the **Steady Growth** and **Seasonal** patterns is already a huge achievement. These cover 90% of real-world infrastructure needs.
* **Reduced "Noise" in Results:** If your forecasting model is struggling to learn the basics, adding a Black Swan event will only make it harder to tell if your model is broken or if it's just reacting to the "surprise" data.
* **Professional Maturity:** Being able to say, *"I identified Black Swan events as a potential edge case but moved them to the 'Future Enhancements' backlog to focus on core model accuracy,"* shows that you understand project management and prioritization.

### How to document it as a "Future Enhancement"

Instead of just deleting the idea, you can add a section in your project documentation (README or Portfolio) titled **"Future Roadmap & Resilience Testing."**

You can frame it like this:

> **Phase 2: Resilience & Anomaly Detection**
> * **Edge Case Simulation:** Implement "Black Swan" scenarios (sudden plateau declines or sharp drops) to evaluate how the engine handles unmodeled structural breaks.
> * **Divergence Alerting:** Integrate a monitoring layer that triggers alerts when actual utilization deviates from the predicted P95 interval by more than  (standard deviations).
> * **Exogenous Inputs:** Incorporate external metadata (e.g., server age, hardware lifecycle dates) to help the model "anticipate" declines that aren't visible in the historical time-series alone.

### Your Next Step

Since we are cutting the Plateau/Decline for now, we should ensure the **Steady Growth** and **Seasonal** generators are absolutely "bulletproof."
