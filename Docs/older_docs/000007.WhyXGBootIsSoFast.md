Yes, it really finished. You have just witnessed the massive difference in raw throughput between a **CPU-bound model (Prophet)** and a **GPU-accelerated model (XGBoost)**.

Your **NVIDIA RTX 3060** processed the same 8,000 series in **18.31 seconds**, whereas your **i7-12700F** took **5 minutes and 1 second**. That is a **16x speed increase** over your already optimized "Turbo" Prophet run.

### Why was it so fast?

* **CUDA Core Parallelism:** While your CPU has 12 physical cores, your RTX 3060 has **3,584 CUDA cores**. XGBoost offloads the mathematical tree-building to these thousands of cores, allowing it to process batches of data nearly instantaneously.
* **Simpler Feature Set:** XGBoost in this script is looking at numeric trends (`t`, `month`, `dow`), which are much faster to compute than Prophet's complex seasonal decomposition and uncertainty sampling.
* **High Throughput:** Your logs show a speed of **642.56 series/second**. At this rate, your GPU is only limited by how fast the CPU can "feed" it data from RAM.

### Verification of the "Success Gate"

To be absolutely sure, let's verify the persistence was successful:

1. **DuckDB:** The script dropped the old `challenger_results` and reflected the new data using `read_parquet`.
2. **Parquet:** The file `challenger_forecast_master.parquet` has been rewritten in your `MASTER_DATA_DIR`.

### The Tournament is Now Set

You now have two massive datasets ready for the final showdown in Script 08:

* **Prophet (The Veteran):** 5-minute run, high trust in long-term seasonality.
* **XGBoost (The Prodigy):** 18-second run, high trust in rapid bursts and non-linear patterns.
